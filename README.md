# PDebug Unity Game Cheat/"Hack" Script
PDebug is a script for Unity (written in C#) that allows users to "Debug" the game it's also nice for "cheating" in other games.

## Ingame Console
Of course there is also an ingame console where the user can see all logs/warnings/erros!

## Edit an GameObject ingame
In the Objects tab you can use the mouse and the "i" key to select a GameObject (The mouse position is called up by the target camera, which can also be changed!) As soon as you have selected a GameObject, you can deactivate/activate it, destroy it , copy it , the position, rotation & scale display and change, deactivate/activate individual components

## Ingame Time Controll
In the "Time" tab you can display the deltaTime and timeScale, and you can also change the timeScale as you like to speed up or slow down the game.

## Invoke Methods
You can invoke an Methode for any Component you want and edit the Parameters of it (Currently not supported all Parameters)!

## Change Values ingame
You can change Values from any Component (Needs to imrpove)

## Load Scene
In the "Load Scene" tab you will see a list of all the scenes and next to it a "Load" button with which you can load the selected scene!

## Easy to implement
The script was only written with GUI, which means that it does not need any external variables that have to be specified in the editor, it simply has to be added to an object!

With the program dnSpy (https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy) you can add the script to a compiled Unity game, but you have to add the script somewhere, which should be easy!

## Video Showcase
Tested with Yooka Laylee https://youtu.be/AGOgQwyecIE (Old Version was used!)

## Is3D Boolean
Don't forget to set the is3D bool correctly in the script!

## Still not finished!
It's need much more imrpoves and maybe new Functions...
