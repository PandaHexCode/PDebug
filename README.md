# PDebug Unity Game Cheat/"Hack" Script
PDebug is a script for Unity (written in C#) that allows users to "Debug" the game it's also nice for "cheating" in other games.

## Ingame Console
Of course there is also an ingame console where the user can see all logs/warnings/erros!

## Edit an GameObject ingame
You can edit GameObjects ingame like deactivate/activate it, destroy it , copy it , change the position, rotation & scale, deactivate/activate individual components and more...

## Invoke Methods
You can invoke an Methode for any Component you want and edit the Parameters of it (Currently not supported all Parameters)!

## Change Values ingame
You can change Values from any Component (Needs to imrpove)

## Ingame Time Controll
In the "Time" tab you can display the deltaTime and timeScale, and you can also change the timeScale as you like to speed up or slow down the game.

## Load Scene
In the "Load Scene" tab you will see a list of all the scenes and next to it a "Load" button with which you can load the selected scene!

# FreeCam
In the "Other" Tab you can activate and disable the FreeCam.

# Change Physics Settings
For having fun you can change the Physics settings ingame like gravity etc (You can open the menu from the Other Tab)

# Inject Custom Dlls
You can inject dlls and use them for easily inject your own code (https://github.com/PandaHexCode/PDebug-CustomDLL-Template)

## Is3D Boolean
Don't forget to set the is3D bool correctly in the script or ingame in the Application Tab!

## Still not finished!
It's need much more imrpoves and maybe new Functions...

## Easy to implement
The script was only written with GUI, which means that it does not need any external variables that have to be specified in the editor, it simply has to be added to an object!

With the program dnSpy (https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy) you can add the script to a compiled Unity game, but you have to add the script somewhere, which should be easy!
